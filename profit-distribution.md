# 💰 Profit Distribution Model

Project Mycelium follows a transparent and automated revenue-sharing model that rewards everyone fairly.

## 📊 Distribution Breakdown

- **Founder** – 40%  
  As the initiator of the project, the founder receives a fixed share for vision, coordination, and initial build.

- **Contributors** – 50%  
  Shared among all active and past contributors, based on measurable impact (lines of code, commits, design assets, etc.).

- **Treasury** – 10%  
  Used for:
  - Hosting & infrastructure
  - Marketing & outreach
  - Future grants or bounties
  - Emergency reserves

## 📁 Tracking Contributions

We use a combination of:
- GitHub commit metadata
- Manual reporting (via Google Form)
- Code ownership analysis tools

## 📆 Distribution Frequency

Payouts and reporting are done **quarterly**, or more frequently if revenue exceeds a certain threshold (to be defined in governance).

## ✍️ Contributor Agreement

All contributors must sign the [Contributor Agreement](./AGREEMENT_TEMPLATE.pdf) and submit the [Contributor Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctIFIYWTs7Map4rujeA_DoNn0XftSlQIRi76rx9imspaZ5eQ/viewform) before they are eligible for rewards.
