# Mycelium - Governance Frontend

This folder contains the frontend of the Mycelium-governance project – an open-source platform built on the principles of transparency, fairness, and collective ownership

## Features

- **Decentralized**: There is no central authority. Decision-making, resource allocation, and coordination are distributed across a network of contributors, ensuring resilience and autonomy.

- **Responsive**: The system adapts in real time to the needs of its participants—whether that’s redistributing tasks, forming new working groups, or initiating governance proposals.

- **Open to All**: Anyone can join, contribute, and be rewarded. Whether you're a developer, designer, researcher, or community builder, your work is recognized and valued.

- **Transparent**: All governance processes, task flows, and financial distributions are documented and visible to the community.

- **Collectively Owned**: Value created is shared fairly through a profit-sharing model, and major decisions are made collaboratively.
