🏛️ Governance Process

Project Mycelium operates with a participatory governance model. Key decisions are made collaboratively, with input from contributors, representatives, and the founder.

🔄 Decision-Making Flow

Proposal Creation

Any contributor can draft a proposal using the Proposal Template.md.

Proposals are submitted via GitHub Issues or a governance form.

Discussion Period

7-day public feedback period on Discord and GitHub.

Community discussion encouraged.

Voting

Active contributors and representatives vote using a weighted system:

Core Contributors: 1 vote

Project Representatives: 2 votes

Founder: Tie-breaker only (if deadlock)

Votes are logged via GitHub or Snapshot (for Web3 integration).

Implementation

Approved proposals are assigned an owner and a timeline.

Changes are reflected in the public roadmap.

🧮 Contribution Metrics
