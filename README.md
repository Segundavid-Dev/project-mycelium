## 📈 Contribution Scoring System

To fairly allocate the contributor revenue share, Mycelium uses a **weighted scoring system** based on objective metrics and peer review.

### 🧮 Contribution Categories

- **Code**: Commits, pull requests, code quality.
- **Design/UI**: Delivered and accepted design assets.
- **Documentation**: Content updates or additions.
- **Community**: Community support, moderation, outreach.
- **Initiatives**: Proposals, feature leadership.

### 📊 Weighting Table

| Category         | Weight (%) |
|------------------|------------|
| Technical (Code) | 40%        |
| Design & UX      | 20%        |
| Docs & Content   | 15%        |
| Community & Ops  | 15%        |
| Initiative Bonus | 10%        |

> Scores are tallied quarterly to determine the share of the 50% contributor pool each person receives.
