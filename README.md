# Mycelium Governance

Welcome to the governance hub of **Project Mycelium** — an open-source platform built on the principles of transparency, fairness, and collective ownership.
This repository contains all documentation, agreements, and processes that guide how contributors are rewarded and how decisions are made.

## 🌱 What is Project Mycelium?

Project Mycelium is a collaborative task platform inspired by the structure and intelligence of natural mycelial networks—the underground root systems of fungi that facilitate communication, nutrient exchange, and mutual support in ecosystems.

Much like its biological counterpart, Project Mycelium is designed to be:

**Decentralized:** There is no central authority. Decision-making, resource allocation, and coordination are distributed across a network of contributors, ensuring resilience and autonomy.

**Responsive:** The system adapts in real time to the needs of its participants—whether that’s redistributing tasks, forming new working groups, or initiating governance proposals.

**Open to All:** Anyone can join, contribute, and be rewarded. Whether you're a developer, designer, researcher, or community builder, your work is recognized and valued.

**Transparent:** All governance processes, task flows, and financial distributions are documented and visible to the community.

**Collectively Owned:** Value created is shared fairly through a profit-sharing model, and major decisions are made collaboratively.

Project Mycelium is not just a platform—it’s an ecosystem for cooperation, where contributors co-create value and shape its future together. It empowers communities to self-organize, share resources, and build sustainably without relying on centralized gatekeepers.

## ⚖️ Profit Sharing Model

- **30%** reserved for the Founder
- **10%** shared among Project Representitives
- **50%** shared among Contributors
- **10%** allocated to the Treasury (for infrastructure, outreach, etc.)
