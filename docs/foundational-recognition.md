# 🌱 Foundational Contributor Recognition Plan

## 📘 Purpose

This document proposes a fair and transparent approach to recognizing the individuals who helped establish the foundation of **Project Mycelium** — before the project was public, funded, or governed by a DAO.

These early contributors took on the risk and effort of setting up core infrastructure, governance, documentation, community strategy, and platform design. As such, they should be acknowledged and rewarded in a way that does not diminish the long-term value or fairness of the open contributor pool.

---

## 🧩 Proposed Model

### ✅ **Cap: 10% of the 50% Contributor Pool**
We propose reserving **up to 10%** of the total contributor pool (which is 50% of overall project revenue) for **Foundational Contributors**.

This would leave **at least 90% of the contributor pool fully open** for future contributions tracked through our scoring and governance system.

| Category                  | Pool Share | Notes                                 |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Total Contributor Pool    | 50%        | Fixed for all contributors             |
| Foundational Reserve (cap)| 5–10%      | To be ratified by DAO vote             |
| Ongoing Contributor Pool  | 40–45%     | Dynamically allocated via scoring      |

---

## 🧠 Alternative Model (Option B)

If the community prefers not to allocate fixed shares:

> Foundational contributors may receive a **retroactive bonus** (scoring multiplier or token drop) once the DAO treasury or token is established, subject to a formal vote.

---

## 📜 Who Qualifies?

Foundational contributors include those who meaningfully contributed to:
- Setting up the initial repositories
- Building early code and design systems
- Defining governance and documentation
- Structuring Discord, onboarding, and coordination
- Shaping the scoring or profit-sharing systems

---

## ✅ Governance Proposal

**Upon MVP launch or DAO activation, we propose:**
- Ratifying a fixed list of 5–10 foundational contributors
- Approving either:
  - A 10% reserve from the contributor pool **OR**
  - A retroactive reward (to be claimed once treasury is active)

---

## 🗳️ Next Steps

- Discuss in [`#governance-chat`](#) and review candidate list
- Submit a Snapshot vote or Discord poll
- Publish ratified shares to [`governance-log.md`](./governance-log.md)
